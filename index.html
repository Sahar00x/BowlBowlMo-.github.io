            <h2>Ramen has been known for being an infamous Japanese delicacy. They say you will only taste the originality of it from Japan itself,
                which is exactly why we have established Bowl Bowl Mo. Bowl Bowl Mo allows us to enjoy this sophisticated dish from home with just 
                a simple 5-10 minute boiling process. Our storefront where we sell our cooked and ready made ramen is located at Calamba, Laguna. If
                you won't be able to access our storefront's location, fear not, for we sell both our cookable ramen packs and our actual dishes on Grab food and Foodpanda.
